description: 'Formentera is an ideal place to relax and enjoy the beaches in a natural environment. Its crystal clear waters, the subtle blue-green coloring that take their funds, their fine white sand, the bright sun and pleasant temperatures are reason enough to call it the last paradise of the Mediterranean, which is worth visiting.'

Formentera has 69 kilometers of coastline on rocky sections alternating with sand and sand beaches. 

Of his twenty beaches, eighteen are considered sand beaches. Since Llevant Beach, one of the most extensive, up small coves of fifty kilometers length such as Cala Codolá, isolated beaches in s'Espalmador Island or Alga Beach, which is only accessible by boat. 

Due to the isolation of the urban beaches, except Cala Savina, is stalled, and Lake d'Es Pujols is peix, it is essential to carry everything you need, because you will not find any establishment around.

Beaches with strong waves are S’ Arenals , Migjorn and Ses Salines, which become the benchmark for all kinds of water sports. In these areas we increase precautions when bathing, because although the Mediterranean Sea is not particularly wild, they usually form a moderate swell. 

Beaches like Cala Saona, Ses Illetes, Cala d'en Borras or Pas de S'Espalmador have plenty of tourist. Calo d'es Morts and Sa Roqueta, for example, have an average occupancy. 

However, in high season, we can find uninhabited places like Punta de sa Pedrera or Ses Canyes, isolated beaches that still retain the flavor of the old Formentera. For lovers of rock beaches, Formentera offers three beautiful beaches, Es Calo des Morts, Es Calo d'en Trull and Cala en Baster, and Tramontana beach where nudists can enjoy without the typical hassles of sand.
